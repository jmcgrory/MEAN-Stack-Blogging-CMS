# MEAN-Stack-Blogging-CMS

MEAN Stack Blog CMS Build with Mongoose/MongoDB, Express, Angular 4 and Node.js, still in production...

# Basic Functionalities

This is a MEAN stack blog for fast and quick blogging on the go, full CRUD capabilities and user authentication, allows multiple users.

 - User Authentication
 - User Post Dashboard
 - Categorisable Posts
 - Full CMS post creation functionality
 - Text/Code/Image input fields for posts
 - Fully custom lightweight styles

Build notes:

 - Backend built in Node.js
 - Express/Bodyparser for handling routing/post and user API
 - Mongoose for MongoDB integration
 - passport for JWT authentication
 - Angular 4 for front end
 - SCSS integrated with Angular for encapsulated global/non-global styles
 - ngx-highlightjs used for code syntax highlighting
 - angular-font-awesome used for font graphics
 - ngx-infinite-scroll added but not currently implemented for dynamic post content loading
 
To-Do:

 - Post CRUD needs authentication headers added to API
 - Full responsiveness/Cross Browser stylings need finishing
 - Post deletion requires post-chunk deletion addition
 - Posts/Post Chunk dynamic loading needs to be integrated on scroll (currently testing ngx-infinite-scroll for this)
 - Written articles need to be uploaded using CMS (not a real concern here)
 - Improve UI for initial load
 - Add animations to post/page navigation
